# Topic-Modelling
Extracting categorical topics and topic likelihood from news articles using topic modelling techniques

Clustering research papers based on the news articles published mentioning the research paper using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in Python.
Dataset: Altmetric dataset consisting of research papers

All the news headlines mentioning research papers are extracted initially, then  NLP techinques were applied removing the stop word and hyperlinks, stemming and lemmatization.
LDA model was applied to the text and all the research papers were assigned to topic by the model.
At the end clustering of those papers were done based the features and topics assigned to the paper.

KeyWords: Natural Language Processing, Stemming, Lemmatization, Stop words, Bigram, Latent Dirichlet Algorithm.
